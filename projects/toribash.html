                <p>A veritable longrunner, Toribash is an odd story in indie gaming, as it is <b>still</b> being played by thousands of players since its inception in early 2006.  Think of it as playing out kung-fu action scenes, with added strategy as it is also multiplayer and turn-based.  And you can customize nearly EVERYTHING about your character</p>

                <p>The members of <code>veb</code> have been helpful in growing Toribash.  Mike has worn many hats: server administrator, virtual economist, web developer, community manager. If it had anything to do with the game running, Mike has done them all.</p>
                <p>Arvin has made many hats... yes.  Toribash is also a 3D hat simulator in its latest incarnation.  If it had to do with site and ingame graphics Arvin has done those.</p>
