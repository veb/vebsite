                <h2>Closed Captioning</h2>
                <p>website: <a href="http://pleasecaption.me">pleasecaption.me</a></p>
                <p>It started as a test to see how quickly we can caption a video of an (oddly enough) <a href="http://pleasecaption.me/example/">news story about the hearing impaired.</a>  It took us from scratch, about an hour's work to make a fully captioned video page using <a href="http://www.video.js">video.js</a> </p>
                <p>It is a demonstration that live video can be easily captioned cheaply, quickly.</p>

                <p>The site is also a small showcase in developing themes and plugins for the <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost blogging platform</a></p>
