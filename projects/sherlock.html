                <p>A Facebook page dedicated to the Victorian sleuth and part time Iron Man...</p>
                <p>It started off as a small fan page to the critically acclaimed BBC series Sherlock.  From nothing, it grew into a 300 thousand strong community of fellow fans complete with active discussions, storytelling... everything you want from a community of enthusiasts.  Which must have caught the eye of the BBC, for they cloned the likes from Modern Sherlock to their official facebook page and subsequently banned our page.  <a href="http://spottedsun.com/someone-stole-sherlocks-300000-likes/">A riveting firsthand account can be read here.</a></p>
                <p>Undettered (and with apologies from Facebook themselves), the community was reinstated and continued to grow.  We've moved on, but the page is still very much active</p>
