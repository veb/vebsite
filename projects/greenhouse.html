                <h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>
                <h3>{{ page.description }}</h3>
                <p>{{ page.title }} rely on tunnel houses and greenhouses to grow both plants and vegetables for the
                    <a href="http://www.otagofarmersmarket.org.nz/">Otago Farmers Market</a>. As the weather in Dunedin, New Zealand 
                    can be extremely unpredictable most of the time the problem was how to monitor, yet control the 'artificial climate'.</p>
                 <p>Certain problems persist:</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>With high temperatures inside, airflow needs to increase</li>
                    <li>Instead of watering twice a day (manually), the plants need to be watered more</li>
                    <li>High temperatures and sunlight pose a problem too, as the plants are completely sheltered from cold wind
                        and therefore ambient lighting is a factor that must be taken into consideration</li>
                    <li>No proper record keeping</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>Most greenhouses and such have similar problems, however commercial systems can range over $100,000 NZD to detect 
                    the problems that {{ page.title }} were having. As a small farmers market business, commercial systems were simply out
                    of their price range.</p>
                 <p></p>
                 <p><a href="https://tessel.io/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/technicalmachine-assets/technical-io/tessel-logo-horizontal.svg" /></a></p>
                 <p>Using a <a href="https://tessel.io/">Tessel board</a> we were able to create a cheap yet efficient solution to their problems.</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Using the Ambient and Temperature module, we recorded the output of each greenhouse and tunnel house to a (responsive)
                        website based on <a href="#">MeteorJS</a>.</li>
                    <li>After the intial testing and gathering of baseline data we added a Servo module to control both the watering and fans</li>
                    <li>Finally, we ended the prototype by allowing {{ page.title }} to add in automatic alerts:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They could set filters which would turn the watering system on at certain ambient lighting and inside temperature.</li>
                        <li>As the website was created with mobile-responsiveness in mind, they were able to keep track of watering remotely</li>
                        <li>Because everything was logged automatically to a database, they were able to tell which temperature range
                            and pH that their plants needed to flourish.</li>
                     </ul>
                  </ul>
                  <p><img src="/assets/images/keenio.svg" /></p>
                  <p>We did find some limitations using MeteorJS, and so we looked at <a href="https://keen.io/">KeenIO</a> and it simply blew us away with what we were able to do, especially in terms of analytics for us, and the client.</p>
                  <p><img src="/assets/images/keenio_tessel.png" /></p>
                  <p>This system was a prototype, and surpassed the expectations of the client. For example, they managed to be able to sell new potatoes
                     more than two months before anyone else in Otago could grow them. Even before big commercial greenhouse businesses.</p>

                   <p>It's really astonishing how such a small piece of technology can give us the ability to focus on what we love rather than maintenance</p>
