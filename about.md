## What we do...

> We make VEBsites, and other interesting goodies. Whether they're iOS or Android applications, we don't mind as long as we're not doing the same thing every day.

-

> That does include developing, marketing and being amazing at creating our own products too. If we see that we can solve something, we're going to solve it, and we're going to do it *just* right.

-

Our biggest aim is make the world a better place. We're not kidding either!

With our flagship mobile platform, [Therable](products/Therable.html) we aim to **truly** to change the world. Even if that starts in New Zealand, it's a stepping stone... to the future. 

We're extremely proud of what we've done so far with Therable, and with the feedback we've received so far, we've been completely astonished. That's really because we **believe** in what we do, and what can achieve. This company, and our flagship product is the most passionate thing we have ever done.

## Who are we?
We are the best people that you can have on your side, ever. Here's why.

### Mike Mackenzie
`co-founder`

> Mike has spent time developing software and networks within the New Zealand healthcare industry. As someone who has been deaf since birth, and recently received his first Cochlear Implant, Mike's got a very good grasp on how the market and software combine here in New Zealand.
	
-

> Mike has always been an extremely practical person, with the ability to mix Information Technology in with the real world. By the flagship product that we're releasing, it shows you that there's been a huge problem in New Zealand for a long time, which he recognised years ago. Now he thinks the time is perfect for people to make the next jump into managing their health better.

* Has a BInfoTech degree
* Has spent more than 8 years as a software developer
* Seemingly knows what he's doing


### Ray Arvin Rimorin
`co-founder`

> Arvin is an experienced mobile, desktop and website developer. He excells cross-platforms, and can pick up new technologies extremely fast. Without him, there would not be a `veb` today. 

-

> In all his years of working, he sees our flagship product as the one thing that can literally turn the tides, and really help people who need it.

* Has a PHD in Astrophysics
* Has been personally awarded a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth the First
* Has personally been ill before
* Has used a smartphone once in his life
* Has previously co-founded a mobile application business, primarily iOS based with funding from interesting people, like Cookie Monster, Mark Zuckerberg and Santa Claws

## When did we start?

We began to work together a few years ago, doing projects here and there. Mike and Arvin met on a wildly popular gaming platform that Mike had helped to create - Arvin seeing the potential too, offered his help. 

Even back then, we were tossing up the idea of the `Therable Platform`, but it wasn't until a few months ago that we decided that the time was about right so we started using all our spare time to develop this. 

After getting over the initial shock of how people received our alpha tests, we didn't hold back and finally started a business. 

We call it `veb` - and no, we won't tell you what it means!

## How do we do all this?

It's quite easy. You come up with an idea, which everyone and their cute kitten can do. 

It's executing the idea correctly from software documentation, future plans, functional requirements, project scopes and then allowing for redundancies.

Sounds familiar? The `difference is we're at the top of our game`. We use different, but better technology when we build for the web, which streamlines our entire process and allows us to spend less time doing mudane developments, and concentrate on what our clients actually need. 

Though... that does seems to be exactly what every other company says in this line of business too.

We do it `slightly different`: we never make one version of something, we always make multiples. The reason for this is so that we can do our "testing" with the _client_ instead of some computer geek. `We use client driven development.`

* It allows the client to know our progress, as if they're part of the team (and they are)
* It allows us to let them know that for their budget, we've got four different options for them to go with. 
	* This may seem rather ultarian but when it comes to price, it's the best thing they can do, and it saves us more time to actually help our clients instead, and build them a much more superior product than their competitiors
* Won't this mean the client will keep saying "Make it pop or we won't pay you!" then we'll politely say no. 

No we're not crazy, we're taking on a different approach. In this approach, we don't charge a small fortune.

> It's about educating the clients about the best practices of the web and the mobile era. We're going to do our best for them, and we're going to do it right. 

-

> If the client wishes not to go down that path, then they're more than welcome to choose someone else -- for a lot more than what we quote.
