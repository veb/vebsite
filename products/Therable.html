				<h1>What IS Therable</h1>
				<div class="image-gradient-dynamic">

				</div>
				<p>
				That's a little broad.  But that's what Therable is.  It's a platform to track and analyze your mood, your health, your fitness regimen, your progress with certain medications... If it can be written in journal form, it can be done in Therable but with a lot of pretty (and useful) graphs and calendars.
				
				<h1>What can Therable be used for?</h1>
				<p>Apart from solving world hunger and curing cancer and making brussels sprouts palatable to children, let's list down some scenarios where Therable can be used</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Let's say you have a mysterious cramp in your leg. Your GP gives you X to help fix it, but every day when you feel the cramp, you log it. At the end of the week, you can see what times it happened, when it happened, where you were etc. Eventually, extra data from wearables can be added (temperature, GPS, your heartrate, etc). Then when you visit the doctor, they'd immediately know what to do.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<p>You're given a new antibiotic.  You log your symptoms and rate if you feel any better.  The doctor would scan your logs and see if it is doing it's desired effect.  If not, you move into a different drug and continue the process</p>
				</blockquote>
				Anything that requires a user to log the progress of an activity.  Where it used to be paper based journals, we use Therable!
				</p>

				<h1>Seems lofty, what was Therable ORIGINALLY for?</h1>
				<p>
				Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. (CBT) is an instrument used in psychotherapy to help people change thoughts, feelings and behaviours that are causing them problems.
				<br/>
				<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">
					<p>
					CBT refers to many types of psychotherapeutic systems that deal with cognitions, interpretations, beliefs and responses. It is used to try and change problem-causing emotions and behaviours.

					It can be used to treat mood disorders (like depression), personality disorders (like borderline personality disorder), posttraumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, phobias and drug addiction. CBT can take place one-on-one between a therapist and a client, during group therapy, or online.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
				There’s currently nothing “online” or on the app stores of Android and Apple, that really efficiently gets the to the point of what CBT is.
				<br/>
				Therable initially addressed in helping people undergoing CBT to log what they are feeling over time.  People undergoing CBT are usually given diaries to write down their emotional status during/after triggers.  We find this under the realm of hormonally charged teens of the 80's-90's.  Who writes a DIARY nowadays?  And the diary they give you are often in small grids barely large enough for what you try to convey, and in the end you just throw it away.
				</p>

				<h1>So how does Therable intend to fix this?</h1>
				<p>
				We’re going to turn a paper-based therapy, into an electronic version and ready for this century. Why would anyone choose this application over a notebook, or whatever their therapist has given them? Easy.
				</p>
				<h3>Story time</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>You’re on a bus. A big smelly man sits next to you. He reminds you of someone, someone who once used to look into your windows whenever he could. You would always know he was there by his smell. You know he went to prison. He’s still there. This man reminds you of him, you’re beginning to get anxious, very anxious, you’re sweating and you want to scream and jump out of the bus but the words from your therapist come sliding through the slog: "Write down what you feel".</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>You have a choice between this</p>
				<ol class="default">
					<li>Open a booklet and start writing, on a shaky bus.  People looking at you funny</li>
					<li>Whip out your phone, pretend you're tweeting like a savvy modern person.  And you get to edit and review what you write on top of it</li>
				</ol>
				<p>The choice is clear </p>

				<div class="item">We believe we're going to revolutionise healthcare</div>
				<div class="item"><h2>Why?</h2> Because Apple just did it for us, and we're ahead of the curve</div>
				<div class="item">Over 90% of people that have seen the application, and have had some sort of therapy experience realise the major potential</div>
				<div class="item">Every professional in their field:<br> psychology and medical have been completely surprised when they've seen the app</div>

				<div class="item">We're solving an issue that every single profession in the healthcare industry has: <h2>TIME</h2>. <p>Unlike MedTech32, where a doctor would enter details, we're changing that to the user.</p></div>

				<div class="item">Doctors already put in information based on what you say<br>so this solves the time problem<br>And it also introduces a whole new field of data processing that's never been done before.</div>

				<div class="item">We've solved a very expensive problem in clinical practices: administration, payroll and patient information. No longer will clinics need to rely on old, outdated and broken technology.</div>

				<div class="item">We've solved the problem of transferring information. Instead of explaining the same thing to every professional you meet, all you need to do is sync your phone to their device. This is a necessity in some parts of the health industry -- Cochlear Implants are very unknown. No longer do you have to wait for someone to ring up a consultant etc to get patient files - the patient gives it to them.</div>

				<div class="item">We're ready for business. We've got the application created, feedback has been provided by both professionals and users and we have the dashboard enterprise version working - which will be offered to professionals as Software as a Service.</div>

				<div class="item">With Apple's recent watch that syncs to an iPhone application to monitor your blood pressure and such while doing fitness, we're doing the exact same thing on their competing platform - and Android, with Google Wear is [insert stats and charts] getting bigger.</div>

				<div class="item">Every single person who has seen the app, and has been explained what it is - including older people who do not own phones, have gone "that's exactly what I've always wanted... it's been such a hassle".</div>

				<div class="item">We believe we have a more robust, and more specialist application that will rival the Apple version. Ours will provide KPI reports, and more, allowing professionals more time to have with their patients, and such. To them, time is worth a lot of money and we have solved that.</div>
